        "**1.What is python and why it is popular?**\n",
        "- Python is a high level programming language known for its simplicity,readability and versitality. Python is so popular because it is easy to learn, it has a lot of libraries and it has a huge active community. Python is widely used in data industries (frontend, backend, databases, image processing, automation, etc).\n",
        "\n",
        "**2.What is an interpreter in python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- An interpreter is a program that reads and executes python code line by line. The python interpreter converts the human-readable python code into bytecode, which is then executed by python runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3.What are pre-defined keywords in python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Pre-defined keywords in python are reserved words that have a special meaning and can't be used as identifiers(like variables, functions, methods etc). for example- if, else, for, while, def, class, break, continue etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4.Can keywords be used as variable names?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-No, keywords cant't be used as variable names because keywords are fixed for special work in python and attempting to use them as a variable name will cause a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5.What is mutability in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- In python mutability refers to wheather the object can be changed after it is created. In python list, sets, dictionary, etc are mutable objects and int, float, string, tuple, etc are immutable objects. immutability means unchangable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Lists are flexible and changable because they are designed for dynamic collection where we often add remove or update elements. whereas in typles they are ment to hold fixed and unchangable data which make them safer, faster and usable as dictionary keys. Thatswhy tuples are immutable and lists are mutable\n",
        "\n",
        "**7.What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- In python '==' operator is called equility operator and is used to compare the values of two objects. It returns True if the contents are same even if they are stored in different memory locations.\n",
        " 'is' operator is called identity operator which compares object identity (memory addresses). It returns True if both variables points to the exact same object in the memory.\n",
        "\n",
        " **8.What are logical operators in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        " - In python logical operators are used to compare conditional statements and returns boolean values (True or False).\n",
        "There are three types of logical operators:-\n",
        "(i) and:- Returns True if both conditions are true.\n",
        "(ii) or:- Returns True if atleast one condition is true.\n",
        "(iii) not:- Returns the opposite of condition. for ex:-print(not True) #false.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9.What is type casting in Python?**\n",
        "- In python type casting means converting a value from one datatype to another with the use of functions like int(), float(), str(). For ex:-\n",
        "\n",
        "a=\"123\"\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**10.What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?**\n",
        "- implicit type casting done automatically by python. It happens when a smaller data type is converter into larger one to avoid data loss.\n",
        " explicit type casting has to be done manually to convert a value from one datatype to another with the use of functions like int(), float(), str().\n",

        "**11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The purpose of conditional statements is to control the flow of execution. They let a program make decision and execute different block of code based on wheather a condition is True or False.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12.How does the elif statement work?**\n",
        "\n",
        "-At first python checks the if condition wheather it is true or false. If fasle then it moves to the first elif condition and checks it. If that is also false it keeps checking the elif conditions(if any). If none of the block are true then the else block (if present) is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13.What is the difference between for and while loops?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- for loop is used when you know how many times you want to repeat something. For loop repeat for a fixed number of iterations or sequence items, sequence like list, string, range.\n",
        "While loop is used when you don't know beforehand how many times to loop. while loop runs as long as condition is true.\n",

        "**14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- A while loop is more suitable when we don't know in advance how many times the loop should run, and the repetition depends on a condition being met.\n",
